<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Microcredit is since the creation of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh by Muhammed Yunus, an institution with an incredible development from the 90s. Its social effect in terms of poverty reduction is more or less accepted by the scientific community, whereas its impact in terms of empowerment towards microcredit clients is commonly agreed.</p>
<p>Even though we know that microcredit programs affect the income level of its clients, it is less likely to know if this additional income has an impact on the education of today's generation and the following—the question here to assess the microcredit impact on client's education and to know its mechanisms. If the link between microcredit and empowerment is settled, it is less likely about microcredit affecting the knowledge capital of its clients and children positively.</p>
<p>Different research results&rsquo; made us acknowledge the obvious link between microcredit and empowerment level, promoting accumulation knowledge condition among woman/mother, strengthen their will and projection in the future. Differences of education expenditure, education gap, health capital and of course, in terms of empowerment are largely verified by different research without actually pinpointing the whole causality relation and interdependences.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of empowerment is a cornerstone in the intergenerational transmission. It is also a necessary condition to accumulate knowledge. Studies on the effect of credit with support like Crédit with Éducation helped us to acknowledge the key role of this psychological and organizational phenomenon's affecting the child greatly. These same studies also participate in the necessity to generalize the spread of these credits with support, as various as useful in terms of education.</p>
<p>As underpinned Christopher Dunford: &ldquo;there is sufficient promising opportunities so that microfinance service suppliers might incorporate other services&rdquo;.They are present in a lot of Parisien areas. This one is yellow. It shows the correct image of this shift of philosphy: link geography and urban sociology to the climate emergency.*</p>
