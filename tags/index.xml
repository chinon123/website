      <description>reference letter from the position at the ministry of environment in 2019 as data scientist
extract and its traduction : Mr. Wang does his job perfectly and much more. His ability to analyze and adapt, his mastery of certain tools such as R, his autonomy and his ability to report in a simple way on technical subjects is an asset for the office. His attitude and interpersonal skills allow for group cohesion in teamwork, particularly in disarming conflicts and facilitating discussions between very different profiles.</description>
